	<p class="firstP">TechCamps are a public diplomacy program hosted in the Bureau of Educational & Cultural Affairs (ECA) at the U.S. Department of State.</p>
		<p class="firstP">TechCamps are hands-on, participant-driven workshops that connect private sector technology experts with key populations — journalists, non-governmental organizations, civil society advocates, and more — to explore and apply innovative tech solutions to global issues. TechCamps are focused on results, with participants identifying real-world challenges and working in partnership with trainers to apply technology solutions to these challenges. Each TechCamp also includes ongoing impact-oriented programs and efforts to help participants implement their projects post-workshop and stay connected and engaged with each other, their trainers, and U.S. State Department staff.

			<p class="firstP">TechCamp began at the U.S. State Department in 2010; the Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) took over the program in 2015 and conducted more than 40 TechCamp workshops all over the world, training more than 2,100 participants from more than 110 countries. In May 2019, the TechCamp program transitioned into the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). Explore our map to see where TechCamp has had an impact. </p>
